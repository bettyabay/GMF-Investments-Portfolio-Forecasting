# GMF Investments Portfolio Forecasting

## Overview
This project uses advanced time series forecasting models to enhance portfolio management for Guide Me in Finance (GMF) Investments. By analyzing historical data for Tesla (TSLA), Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND), and S&P 500 ETF (SPY), we aim to forecast market trends, optimize asset allocation, and manage risk. The project employs ARIMA, SARIMA, and LSTM models to provide data-driven investment recommendations.

## Project Goals
- **Market Trend Forecasting:** Predict future market trends for TSLA, BND, and SPY.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Optimize portfolio allocation for balanced returns and risk management.
- **Risk Management:** Adjust portfolio strategy based on predicted volatility.

## Data Sources
- **Tesla (TSLA):** High-growth, high-volatility stock.
- **Vanguard Total Bond Market ETF (BND):** Bond ETF for stability and income.
- **S&P 500 ETF (SPY):** ETF representing U.S. market exposure.

Historical data includes Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Adjusted Close prices from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2024.
